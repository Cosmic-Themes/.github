# Welcome to Cosmic Themes

This github organization contains all of the themes and associated items you have access to. 

If you should have access to something and you don't, or need access to the private discord server, send me a messsage at creator@cosmicthemes.com or in the discord and we'll get it sorted!

## Getting started with a theme

1. Fork the theme repo you want to use to your own github account
2. Clone the forked repo to your local computer
3. Follow the README in the specific theme repo and edit to your heart's content!
